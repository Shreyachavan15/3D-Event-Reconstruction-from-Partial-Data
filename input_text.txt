The crime scene was located inside a residential apartment situated on the third floor of a multi-storied building in a quiet neighborhood. Upon arrival, the investigating officers observed that the main entrance door was unlocked, with no visible signs of forced entry. This immediately suggested that the victim may have known the assailant. The apartment appeared dimly lit, creating an unsettling atmosphere, and the air inside was heavy with the metallic odor of blood.

The living room showed clear signs of disturbance. Furniture was displaced, and a glass table lay shattered on the floor, indicating that a struggle had taken place. However, there were no visible bloodstains in this area, suggesting that the altercation may have begun here and later moved to another part of the apartment. Household items were scattered, reflecting panic and resistance during the incident.

The bedroom was identified as the primary crime scene. The victim, a young adult male, was found lying motionless on the floor near the bed. His body was positioned on his back, and large pools of blood were present beneath his torso. Bloodstains were observed on the bed sheets, floor, and adjacent wall, forming clear patterns that indicated repeated stab injuries. Defensive wounds were visible on the victim’s arms, suggesting an attempt to protect himself during the attack.

A blood-stained knife, believed to be the murder weapon, was found near the body. The presence of this weapon, along with multiple stab wounds, pointed toward a violent and intentional act. Partial fingerprints were recovered from the door handle and nearby furniture, while a mobile phone found on the bedside table was collected for further forensic examination. Footwear impressions discovered on the bedroom floor indicated the possible presence of another individual at the scene.

Based on the condition of the body and the onset of rigor mortis, investigators estimated that the death occurred approximately one to two hours before the crime scene examination. No evidence of forced exit was found, further strengthening the possibility that the perpetrator left the scene calmly after the incident. A neighbor later reported hearing loud voices and an argument shortly before the estimated time of death.

In conclusion, the crime scene strongly indicated a case of homicide. The nature of the injuries, the lack of forced entry, and the signs of struggle suggested a personal motive rather than a random attack. Further forensic analysis, including DNA testing and post-mortem examination, was recommended to confirm the findings and identify the perpetrator.
